# Litro

Litro (*Li*nux Ly*tro*) aims to provide an open source alternative to the Lytro Desktop.

The application has been tested only with the original Litro camera, although the Lytro Illum
may work, too.

## License
Most of the Litro is licensed under LGPL v3, only the Qt GUI (in the ui/ subdirectory)
is licensed under GPL v3.
