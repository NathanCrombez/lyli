# Lyli

Lyli (*Ly*tro *Li*nux) aims to provide an open source alternative to the Lytro Desktop.

The application has been tested only with the original Lytro camera, although the Lytro Illum
may work, too.

Most of the Lyli is licensed under LGPL v3, only the Qt GUI (in the ui/ subdirectory)
is licensed under GPL v3.
